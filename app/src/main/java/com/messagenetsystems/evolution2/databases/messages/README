This is all modelled after:
https://www.simplifiedcoding.net/android-room-database-example/

This database is the persistent copy of run-time message data (active messages, etc.)
It is what we would need to read back in upon app restart or something, in order to know the most recent saved message state.
Message state includes things like how many times audio repeated, at what point a video file needs to resume, etc.


MessageMessagenet                   A Room "entity", this is kind of like a record schema. Room handles multiple records for us, so it's effectively a table.
MessageMessagenetDao                Define how to interact with the entity class. (this is our SQL and methods stuff)
MessageMessagenetDatabase           A kind of holder (wrapper?) class that makes the Dao class available for use.
MessageMessagenetDatabaseClient     How we layer out our singleton access and expose the entity to for our code. (this is how other packages interact with our little DB package here)
