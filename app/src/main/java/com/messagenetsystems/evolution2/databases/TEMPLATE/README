This is all modelled after:
https://www.simplifiedcoding.net/android-room-database-example/


TemplateData                   A Room "entity", this is kind of like a record schema. Room handles multiple records for us, so it's effectively a table.
TemplateDataDao                Define how to interact with the entity class. (this is our SQL and methods stuff)
TemplateDataDatabase           A kind of holder (wrapper?) class that makes the Dao class available for use.
TemplateDataDatabaseClient     How we layer out our singleton access and expose the entity to for our code. (this is how other packages interact with our little DB package here)
