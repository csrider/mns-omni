These threads are standalone tasks that are (mostly) intended to run in the background.
You should use the .start() method on their instances to start a new thread and run their stuff in the background.
For long-running stuff, do that in MainService, for the most part.

As long as you follow the template, these should automatically stop whenever cleanup is called.
